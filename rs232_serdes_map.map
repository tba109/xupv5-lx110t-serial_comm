Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    70 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          184
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            53 out of     184   28%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  40 out of     184   21%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          91 out of     184   49%
    Number of unique control sets:              23
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              38 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        32 out of     640    5%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.39

Peak Memory Usage:  573 MB
