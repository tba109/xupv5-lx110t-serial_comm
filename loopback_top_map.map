Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    60 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  60
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        113 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as logic:                      111 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              83
      Number using O5 output only:              24
      Number using O5 and O6:                    4
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         2
  Number of route-thrus:                        26
    Number using O6 output only:                26

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    41 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          116
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            56 out of     116   48%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   3 out of     116    2%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          57 out of     116   49%
    Number of unique control sets:               2
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               4 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                         4 out of     640    1%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                        4 out of       4  100%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.73

Peak Memory Usage:  991 MB
